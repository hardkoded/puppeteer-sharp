# DocFX configuration

## Customizations

These are the changes made in the custom template.

* `conceptual.html.primary.js`: Add the `docurl` pointing to the GitHub issues page.
* 'logo.svg` is the puppeteer-sharp logo.
* `ManagedReference.common.js` is the same as the one in `common` but we are setting the `docurl` to point to the GitHub issues page.
* `token.json`. We change the `improveThisDoc` text.
* `partials/class.header.tmpl.partial`: The `inherited members` section was removed.
